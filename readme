non-navigraph sids and stars free for use.
probably out of date.
submissions and updates welcome.

Procedures made by me :

    EBBR : full sids + Batty5a star + an approach on the 07L
    EGKK : full stars + Adma2x sid
    EGLL : LOGA1H and LOGA1F stars
    LSGG : 4 stars (AKITO2N AKITO2R BELUS3N BELUS3R) and 2 sids (ARBO8N DIPIR6A)

I've not tested all the procedures, there may be some errors.
